## Hi there, I'm Arthur Cadore! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate embedded software and distribuited telecomunication/software systems with a strong background in network protocols and technologies. My journey in tech has led me to explore various technologies, from FPGA to active filter signal processing to java RESTful development to integrate with backend application as MQTTbroker. I'm currently diving deep into studying new network protocols and technologies, for DevOps applications. 

## Below are some of my statistics:
